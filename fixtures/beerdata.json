It was discovered the good folks over at Kafka\u2019s Cafe on Main Street & the Mexican Maestro\u2019s at local favourite Sal Y Limon had got their noggins together to create this Horchata Cold Brew. They were kind enough to share their recipe secrets, even going so far as make a little cold brew to add for a subtle hint of coffee.\r\n\r\nJeffrey & Nigel returned to the brewery, triumphant with an incredible new beer idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cFantasmagoria\u201d was born.

We developed an Oatmeal Stout with loads of rich cocoa and toasted malt notes to compliment the heaps of hand toasted coconut the beer is aged on. To accentuate the tropical notes of coconut we added in an obscene amount of sea salt which in turn helps cut through the rich oatmeal laden body to help transform what could be considered a dessert beer into a sessionable inky black elixir. Its silky velvet-like body aides in draping the coconut from the front to the back of your tongue, only thinning out as the salt hits the palate, inducing just the slightest amount of salivation, helping this creamy coconut bomb wash clean and keeping it incredibly drinkable for a stout that is darker than the Alaskan sky in winter. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this German Chocolate Cake inspired Stout while soaking in the sun's rays at your favorite beer garden or hunkered down by a fireplace as the cool night hits.",

Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour.

Today, half a century later, we are carrying on that tradition \u2014 brewing an honest beer and an honest light beer from that same classic recipe.\r\n\r\nTraditional BC Lager is as good as it gets: An easy-drinking beer providing unparalleled refreshment. Well-balanced, slightly redolent of fresh herbs, this brew will enhance whatever or whomever it accompanies. Great with spicy food or roast chicken.",
