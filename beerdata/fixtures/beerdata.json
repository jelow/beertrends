A combination of stewed crystal malts and roasted barley gives Red Cap its distinctive garnet color and light tan head. The aroma is malty sweet with a light hint of Northwest hops. The flavor is primarily toffee-like malt with a crisp hop balance and slightly dry finish from the roasted barley. Red Cap is a versatile beer that pairs well with a variety of foods. The caramel flavors from crystal malt would nicely complement a well-seared steak or burger or even blackened salmon. The smooth, crisp finish make it a natural with pizza. The malty sweetness can ease fiery Mexican or Asian dishes. Try Red Cap with sharp cheeses, fruits and nuts. Irish Red Ales originated in the town of Kilkenny in 1710 as an offshoot of the English Pale Ales of the day. The addition of roasted barley gave the beer a darker color and drier finish than its English counterparts.

Pippins cider reflects the story of how apple varieties developed during North America\u2019s pioneering age, when many of the Old World varieties failed to thrive, but their seeds produced a generation of new varieties. The Yellow Newton Pippin is one such apple, and the main varietal in Sea Cider\u2019s Pippins. This apple is high in both acid and sugar (important features in traditional North American cider varieties).  Pippins cider is made in the New England pre-Prohibition style, which means sharply acidic, but balanced with subtle sweetness, and high in alcohol thanks to chapitalization. Fermentation is undertaken at cool temperatures to preserve fruity aromas and to maintain the acidity. A dosage of organic cane sugar is added during fermentation to raise the level of alcohol (this was traditionally important to improve the shelf life of cider during the pioneering days).\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:\r\nAppearance: Effervescent, warm straw in colour, clear, bright.\r\nAromas, flavours: Citrus, apple, pear, lemongrass, pineapple, confectionary.\r\nAcid/sweetness: Intense acidity, balanced by slight residual sweetness.\r\nMouthfeel: Crisp, sharp to the tongue.", "ibu": 72, "abv": "9.50", "srm": 43, "og": "1.08", "fg": "1.01", "label": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/sj5PSg/upload_sPleHx-large.png", "brewery": "jXi6nH"}}, {"model": "beerdata.beer", "pk": "Skb0ip", "fields": {"name": "Mango Wheat Ale", "desc": null, "ibu": 29, "abv": "5.90", "srm": 3, "og": "1.04", "fg": "0.99", "label": null, "brewery": "g3LBSs"}}, {"model": "beerdata.beer", "pk": "SLrXnH", "fields": {"name": "Pumpkineater", "desc": "A high gravity pumpkin ale brewed with barley, fresh roasted pumpkin, hops, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, water and yeast, it is one of the local seasonal favorites.
